Abstract

Developments in the field of artificial intelligence are increasing day by day. However, the same developments come with high transaction costs. It is known that a significant part of these costs is related to training artificial intelligence.  Apart from this, there is also a search for finding alternatives to this situation. One of these is the reservoir calculation method, which uses a static neural reservoir as the hidden layer and a single-layer interpreter output layer trained to interpret it. As mentioned in this method, the only trained part is the output layer and the reservoir is more dynamic. It is used as a data recording system. Although the system seems so simple, many studies have yielded very efficient results.

In this project, you will find the codes I wrote, including my ideas about which AI techniques can be combined with reservoir calculation and how the Reservoir section can be optimized.
